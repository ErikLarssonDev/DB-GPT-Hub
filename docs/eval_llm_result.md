# Evaluation LLM For Text-to-SQL

This doc aims to summarize the performance of publicly available big language models when evaluated on the spider dev dataset. We hope it will provide a point of reference for folks using these big models for Text-to-SQL tasks. We'll keep sharing eval results from models we've tested and seen others use, and very welcome any contributions to make this more comprehensive.

It's important to note that our evaluation results are obtained based on the current project's relevant parameters. We strive to provide objective assessments, but due to variations in certain parameters like the temperature value, different individuals may derive different results using different methods. These results should be taken as **reference only**. We welcome more peers to contribute your evaluation results (along with the corresponding parameter values).  

If you have improved methods for objective evaluation, we warmly welcome contributions to the project's codebase.
