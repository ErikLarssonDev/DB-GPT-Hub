Here's an example query: ``` SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.Singer_ID) FROM singer s JOIN singer_in_concert sic ON s.Singer_ID = sic.Singer_ID; ``` This query will join the singer and singer_in_concert tables on the Singer_ID column, and then count the distinct Singer_ID 1s in the resulting table. This will give you the total number of singers.  Note that this query assumes that the Singer_ID column in the singer table is the primary key, and that the Singer_ID column in the singer_in_concert table is the foreign key that references the Singer_ID column in the singer table. If these assumptions are not correct, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

It then groups the results by country and counts the number of distinct singer_id 1s for each country.  The result of this query will be a table with two columns: country and num_singers. The country column will contain the name of each country, and the num_singers column will contain the number of singers from that country.  For example, if the database contains the following data: ``` +---------+---------+----------+ | singer_id | singer_name | country | +---------+---------+----------+ | 1        | John       | USA     | | 2        | Jane       | USA     | | 3        | Bob        | Canada  | | 4        | Sarah      | Canada  | | 5        | Mark       | UK      | | 6        | Emma       | UK      | +---------+---------+----------+ ``` The query will return the following result: ``` +---------+---------+ | country | num_singers | +---------+---------+ | USA     | 2          | | Canada  | 2          | | UK      | 2          | +---------+---------+ ``` This shows that there are 2 singers from the USA, 2 singers from Canada, and 2 singers from the UK.

It then filters the results to only include singers who are older than the average age of all the singers in the database.  Note that this query assumes that the singer table has a column called "Age" that contains the age of each singer, and that the singer_in_concert table has a column called "Song_Name" that contains the name of the song for each concert.

hard pred: To find the number of concerts that occurred in the stadium with the largest capacity, you can use a SQL query that joins the `concert` and `stadium` tables on the `Stadium_ID` column, and then groups the results by `Stadium_ID` and `Capacity`. The query should look something like this: ``` SELECT COUNT(*) as num_concerts, Stadium_ID, Capacity FROM concert JOIN stadium ON concert.Stadium_ID = stadium.Stadium_ID GROUP BY Stadium_ID, Capacity ORDER BY Capacity DESC; ``` This query will return a list of rows, each representing a different stadium and its capacity. The `COUNT(*)` function will count the number of concerts that occurred in each stadium, and the `GROUP BY` clause will group the results by `Stadium_ID` and `Capacity`. The `ORDER BY` clause will sort the results by `Capacity` in descending order, so that the largest capacity stadiums will be listed first.  You can also use a subquery to find the largest capacity stadium and then use it to find the number of concerts that occurred in that stadium. ``` SELECT COUNT(*) as num_concerts FROM concert WHERE Stadium_ID = (SELECT Stadium_ID FROM stadium ORDER BY Capacity DESC LIMIT 1); ``` This query will return the number of concerts that occurred in the largest capacity stadium.  Please note that the above queries are just examples and you may need to adjust them to fit your specific database schema and data.

Here is the SQL command: ``` SELECT AVG(s.Age) FROM Student s WHERE s.StuID NOT IN (   SELECT hp.StuID   FROM Has_Pet hp ); ``` Explanation:  * The subquery `SELECT hp.StuID FROM Has_Pet hp` returns the set of students who own at least one pet. * The main query `SELECT AVG(s.Age) FROM Student s WHERE s.StuID NOT IN (subquery)` filters the students in the `Student` table based on the set of students who own at least one pet, and then calculates the average age of the remaining students.  Note that this query assumes that the `StuID` column in the `Has_Pet` table is a foreign key that references the `StuID` column in the `Student` table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `JOIN` conditions are used to match the `MakeId` column in the `cars_data` table with the `MakeId` column in the `car_names` table, and the `Model` column in the `car_names` table with the `Model` column in the `model_list` table. The `JOIN` conditions are also used to match the `Id` column in the `car_makers` table with the `Country` column in the `countries` table, and the `Continent` column in the `continents` table with the `ContId` column in the `continents` table.

It then joins the `model_list` table with the `car_names` table to get the model and maker of each car. It then joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table to get the country of each maker. Finally, it joins the `countries` table with the `car_makers` table to get the continent of each country.  The query then calculates the average miles per gallon for each model by grouping the results by model and calculating the average of the `mpg` column. Finally, it sorts the results by the average miles per gallon in descending order, so that the model that saves the most gasoline is listed first.  Note that this query assumes that the `mpg` column is the number of miles per gallon that a car can travel on a full tank of gasoline. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

It then filters the results based on the `MPG` column, selecting only the rows with the highest `MPG` 1.  Note that this query assumes that the `MPG` column is a numeric column and that the `car_names` table has a `MakeId` column that matches the `MakeId` column in the `cars_data` table. If these assumptions are not correct, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The AVG function is then used to calculate the average edispl of these cars.  Note that this command assumes that the tables are properly normalized and have appropriate foreign key relationships between them. If the tables are not properly normalized, the query may not return the correct results.

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results by the `Accelerate` column in ascending order, and the `LIMIT` clause is used to only return the first result (i.e., the car with the least accelerate).  Note that this query assumes that the `continents` table contains the continent name for each country, and that the `car_makers` table contains the country name for each car maker. If these assumptions are not correct, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

Based on the provided schema, the table is "cars_data".  To find the number of cars with a larger accelerate than the car with the largest horsepower, we can use a SQL query that joins the "cars_data" table with itself to find the car with the largest horsepower, and then uses a subquery to find the cars with a larger accelerate than that car.  Here's the SQL query: ``` SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cars_data AS c1 JOIN cars_data AS c2 ON c1.Id = c2.MakeId WHERE c1.Horsepower < c2.Horsepower AND c1.Accelerate > c2.Accelerate; ``` This query joins the "cars_data" table with itself on the "Id" column, which is the foreign key that connects the "cars_data" table to the "car_names" table. The "WHERE" clause filters the results to only include cars with a larger accelerate than the car with the largest horsepower.  The "COUNT(*)" function is used to count the number of rows in the resulting table, which gives us the number of cars with a larger accelerate than the car with the largest horsepower.  Note that this query assumes that the "Id" column in the "cars_data" table is the primary key, and that the "MakeId" column in the "car_names" table is the foreign key that connects the two tables. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

It then groups the result by the `CountryId` column and filters the result to only include countries that have more than 2 car makers. The `COUNT(DISTINCT cm.Id)` function is used to count the number of distinct car makers for each country.  The resulting number of countries that have more than 2 car makers is returned in the `num_countries` column.

The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause selects only the unique rows from the `car_makers` table. 2. The `JOIN` clause joins the `car_makers` table with the `model_list` table on the `Id` column of the `car_makers` table and the `Maker` column of the `model_list` table. 3. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows by the `Id` and `Maker` columns of the `car_makers` table. 4. The `HAVING` clause filters the groups to only include those that have at least 2 distinct models and more than 3 cars.  Note that this command assumes that the `cars_data` table is not included in the question, and that the weight of a car is not relevant to the question. If the `cars_data` table is included, you may need to modify the command accordingly.

extra pred: To answer this question, we need to first identify the countries that have more than 3 car makers. We can use a SQL query to do this.  First, we need to join the tables `countries` and `car_makers` on the foreign key `CountryId` in `countries` and `Id` in `car_makers`. This will give us a list of all countries that have at least one car maker.  Next, we need to group the results by country and count the number of car makers for each country. We can use the `COUNT` function to do this.  Finally, we need to filter the results to only include countries that have more than 3 car makers. We can use a `HAVING` clause to do this.  Here is the complete SQL query: ``` SELECT c.CountryId, c.CountryName FROM countries c JOIN car_makers cm ON c.CountryId = cm.CountryId GROUP BY c.CountryId, c.CountryName HAVING COUNT(cm.Id) > 3; ``` This query will return a list of all countries that have more than 3 car makers. The `CountryId` and `CountryName` columns will be included in the results.  To answer the second part of the question, we need to join the `car_names` table with the `cars_data` table on the foreign key `MakeId`. This will give us a list of all cars that produce the 'fiat' model.  Next, we need to filter the results to only include cars that produce the 'fiat' model. We can use a `WHERE` clause to do this.  Here is the complete SQL query: ``` SELECT cn.MakeId, cn.Model FROM car_names cn JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.MakeId WHERE cn.Model = 'fiat'; ``` This query will return a list of all cars that produce the 'fiat' model. The `MakeId` and `Model` columns will be included in the results.  I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

It then joins the `cars_data` table on the `MakeId` column.  The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those countries that have more than 3 car makers or produce Fiat models. The `SELECT` clause returns the `CountryId` and `CountryName` columns.  Note that this query assumes that the `CountryId` column in the `car_makers` table is a foreign key referencing the `CountryId` column in the `countries` table, and that the `Model` column in the `model_list` table is a foreign key referencing the `Model` column in the `car_names` table.

Here is an example query: ``` SELECT Airline FROM flights JOIN airlines ON flights.Airline = airlines.uid GROUP BY Airline HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10; ``` This query joins the flights table with the airlines table on the Airline column, and then groups the results by Airline. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include airlines with at least 10 flights.  Note that this query assumes that the Airline column in the flights table is a foreign key that references the uid column in the airlines table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

medium pred: To find the airlines with less than 200 flights, you can use a SQL query that joins the flights table with the airlines table on the Airline column, and then filters the results to only include airlines with less than 200 flights.  Here is an example query: ``` SELECT Airline FROM flights f JOIN airlines a ON f.Airline = a.uid WHERE COUNT(f.FlightNo) < 200; ``` This query joins the flights table with the airlines table on the Airline column, and then filters the results to only include airlines with less than 200 flights. The COUNT function is used to count the number of flights for each airline, and the WHERE clause is used to filter the results to only include airlines with less than 200 flights.  Note that this query assumes that the uid column in the airlines table is the primary key, and that the FlightNo column in the flights table is the primary key. If these assumptions are not correct, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

Here is an example SQL query that should accomplish this: ``` SELECT airports.AirportName FROM airports LEFT JOIN flights ON airports.AirportCode = flights.SourceAirport WHERE flights.SourceAirport IS NULL; ``` This query uses a left join to combine the airports table with the flights table on the SourceAirport column. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include airports that do not have any flights.  Note that this query assumes that the airport code is the primary key of the airports table, and that the foreign key in the flights table refers to the airport code. If these assumptions are not correct, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

hard pred: To find which airports do not have departing or arriving flights, you can use a SQL query that joins the flights table with the airports table on the SourceAirport and DestAirport columns, and then uses a WHERE clause to filter out airports that have flights.  Here is an example SQL query that should accomplish this: ``` SELECT airports.AirportCode, airports.AirportName FROM airports LEFT JOIN flights ON flights.SourceAirport = airports.AirportCode LEFT JOIN flights ON flights.DestAirport = airports.AirportCode WHERE flights.Airline IS NULL ``` This query first joins the flights table with the airports table on the SourceAirport and DestAirport columns. This creates a table with all airports and their corresponding flights.  The next step is to use a WHERE clause to filter out airports that have flights. In this case, we want to find airports that do not have any flights, so we use the IS NULL operator to check if the flights.Airline column is null.  Finally, we select the AirportCode and AirportName columns from the airports table, which should give us the list of airports that do not have departing or arriving flights.  Note that this query assumes that the airports table has a primary key column called AirportCode, and that the flights table has foreign key columns called SourceAirport and DestAirport that reference the AirportCode column of the airports table. If your tables have different column names, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

easy pred: To sort the employee names by their age in ascending order, you can use the following SQL command: ``` SELECT Name, Age FROM employee ORDER BY Age ASC; ``` This command will select the `Name` and `Age` columns from the `employee` table and sort the results in ascending order based on the `Age` column.  Alternatively, you can also use the `ORDER BY` clause with the `ASC` keyword to sort the results in ascending order: ``` SELECT Name, Age FROM employee ORDER BY Age ASC; ``` This will give you the same result as the previous command.  Note that the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results of a query based on one or more columns. In this case, we are sorting the results based on the `Age` column, which is a numeric column. The `ASC` keyword is used to specify that we want to sort the results in ascending order (i.e., from lowest to highest).

Here is an example query that should produce the desired results: ``` SELECT City, COUNT(DISTINCT Employee_ID) AS Num_Employees FROM employee JOIN hiring ON employee.Employee_ID = hiring.Employee_ID GROUP BY City; ``` This query will join the employee and hiring tables on the Employee_ID column, and then count the number of distinct Employee_ID 1s for each City. The results will be grouped by City, so you will get one row for each city with the number of employees from that city.  I hope this helps!

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate employee IDs, and the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by city.  You can also use a subquery to get the same result: ``` SELECT City, COUNT(DISTINCT Employee_ID) AS num_employees FROM employee WHERE Employee_ID IN (   SELECT Employee_ID   FROM hiring   WHERE Is_full_time = 1 ); ``` This query will return the number of full-time employees for each city in the `num_employees` column. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results to only include employees who are full-time. The `IN` operator is used to check if the `Employee_ID` in the `hiring` table is in the `Employee_ID` column of the `employee` table.

Here is an example SQL query that should return the cities where more than one employee under the age of 30 come from: ``` SELECT DISTINCT s.City FROM employee e JOIN shop s ON e.Shop_ID = s.Shop_ID JOIN hiring h ON e.Employee_ID = h.Employee_ID WHERE e.Age < 30 GROUP BY s.City HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` This query joins the employee, shop, and hiring tables on the Employee_ID column, and filters the results based on the age of the employees. It then groups the results by city and filters the results to only include cities where more than one employee under the age of 30 come from.  Note that this query assumes that the Employee_ID column in the hiring table is a foreign key referencing the Employee_ID column in the employee table. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the query accordingly.

Here is an example query: ``` SELECT Location, COUNT(DISTINCT Shop_ID) AS Num_shops FROM shop JOIN hiring ON shop.Shop_ID = hiring.Shop_ID GROUP BY Location; ``` This query will return a result set with two columns: Location and Num_shops. The Location column will contain the name of each location, and the Num_shops column will contain the number of shops in that location.  For example, if there are three shops in the "New York" location and two shops in the "Los Angeles" location, the query will return the following result set: ``` Location | Num_shops -------------------- New York | 3 Los Angeles | 2 ``` Note that the COUNT(DISTINCT Shop_ID) function is used to count the number of distinct shops in each location, rather than the number of rows in the hiring table. This is because a single employee may be hired by multiple shops in the same location, so we need to count the number of unique shops in each location.

It then uses this maximum number to filter the `shop` table and select only the rows where the `Number_products` column matches the maximum 1. Finally, it extracts the `Manager_name` and `District` columns from the filtered rows.  Note that this command assumes that the `Number_products` column is of an integer data type and that the `Manager_name` and `District` columns are of a string data type. If the data types of these columns are different, you may need to modify the command accordingly.

It then uses this 1 to filter the `shop` table to only include rows where the `Number_products` column has the maximum 1. Finally, it extracts the `Manager_name` and `District` columns from the resulting rows.  Note that this query assumes that the `Number_products` column is a numeric column that represents the number of products sold by each shop.

The `WHERE` clause then filters the results to only include the employee with the highest one time bonus.  Note that this query assumes that the `Bonus` column is a numeric column, and that you want to find the employee with the highest one time bonus among all employees. If you want to find the employee with the highest one time bonus for a specific year, you can add a `WHERE` clause to the query that filters the results to only include the evaluation for that year. For example: ``` SELECT e.Name FROM employee e INNER JOIN evaluation e ON e.Employee_ID = e.Employee_ID WHERE e.Bonus = (SELECT MAX(Bonus) FROM evaluation WHERE Year_awarded = 2023) ``` This query will find the employee with the highest one time bonus for the year 2023.

easy pred: To get all the information about hiring, you can use the following SQL command: ``` SELECT * FROM hiring ``` This command will return all the columns from the `hiring` table.  Alternatively, you can specify which columns you want to retrieve by using the `SELECT` clause followed by the column names. For example: ``` SELECT Shop_ID, Employee_ID, Start_from, Is_full_time FROM hiring ``` This command will return only the `Shop_ID`, `Employee_ID`, `Start_from`, and `Is_full_time` columns from the `hiring` table.  Note that the `*` wildcard can be used to retrieve all columns from a table. However, it is generally not recommended to use the `*` wildcard in production code, as it can make the code less readable and more prone to errors.

hard pred: To find the district that has both stores with less than 3000 products and stores with more than 10000 products, you can use the following SQL query: ``` SELECT DISTINCT d.District FROM shop s JOIN district d ON s.Location = d.Location WHERE s.Number_products < 3000 AND s.Number_products > 10000 ``` This query joins the `shop` table with the `district` table on the `Location` column, and then filters the results to only include districts that have both stores with less than 3000 products and stores with more than 10000 products. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate districts from the results.  Note that this query assumes that the `district` table has a column called `Location` that corresponds to the `Location` column in the `shop` table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

easy pred: To find the number of documents, you can use the following SQL query: ``` SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Document_ID) AS Num_Documents FROM Documents; ``` This query will count the number of distinct `Document_ID` 1s in the `Documents` table. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicates, and the `COUNT` function is used to count the number of rows.  The result of this query will be a single row with a single column containing the number of documents. For example, if the query returns a 1 of 10, it means that there are 10 distinct documents in the `Documents` table.

Alternatively, you can also use the following command to count the number of documents for a specific template type: ``` SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Documents WHERE Template_Type_Code = 'TEMPLATE_TYPE_CODE'; ``` Replace `'TEMPLATE_TYPE_CODE'` with the actual template type code you want to count the documents for.  For example, if you want to count the number of documents for the template type with code `ABC`, you can use the following command: ``` SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Documents WHERE Template_Type_Code = 'ABC'; ``` This command will return the total number of documents in the `Documents` table that have a `Template_Type_Code` of `ABC`.

It then filters the results to only include documents with a description containing the letter 'w'.  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_Type_Description` column in the `Ref_Template_Types` table contains the description of the template type, and that the `Template_Type_Code` column in the `Templates` table contains the code of the template type. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.

It then filters the results to only include documents with the name "Robbin CV".  The `Document_ID` column from the `Documents` table is selected, along with the `Template_ID` and `Template_Description` columns from the `Templates` table.  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_ID` and `Template_Type_Code` columns in the `Templates` table are not nullable. If they are nullable, you may need to use a left join instead of an inner join.

The query would look like this: ``` SELECT Template_Type_Code, COUNT(DISTINCT Template_ID) AS num_templates FROM Templates JOIN Documents ON Templates.Template_ID = Documents.Template_ID JOIN Paragraphs ON Documents.Document_ID = Paragraphs.Document_ID GROUP BY Template_Type_Code; ``` This query will return the number of different templates that each document uses, along with the corresponding Template_Type_Code. The `COUNT(DISTINCT Template_ID)` function is used to count the number of unique templates that each document uses, while the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by Template_Type_Code.  Note that this query assumes that the Template_ID and Document_ID columns in the Templates and Documents tables are foreign keys that reference the primary key columns in the Paragraphs table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

It then selects the `Document_ID`s of all documents that reference these templates in the `Documents` table. Finally, it counts the number of documents that are referenced by at least one template with type code 'PPT'.  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_ID` column in the `Documents` table is a foreign key referencing the `Template_ID` column in the `Templates` table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

medium pred: To achieve the required output, you can use a SQL query that joins the `Templates`, `Documents`, and `Paragraphs` tables on the foreign keys `Template_ID` and `Document_ID`, and then groups the results by `Template_ID` to get the number of documents using each template.  Here's an example SQL query that should work: ```sql SELECT t.Template_ID, COUNT(DISTINCT d.Document_ID) AS num_documents FROM Templates t JOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID GROUP BY t.Template_ID ``` This query will return a result set with two columns: `Template_ID` and `num_documents`, where `num_documents` is the number of documents using each template.  Note that the `DISTINCT` keyword in the `COUNT` function is used to count the number of unique documents using each template, rather than the total number of documents. This is because a document can be associated with multiple paragraphs, and we only want to count each document once, even if it's associated with multiple paragraphs.

You can also use a subquery to get the same result: ``` SELECT Template_ID, COUNT(Template_ID) AS num_documents FROM (   SELECT Template_ID   FROM Documents   GROUP BY Template_ID ) AS subquery; ``` This will give you the same result as the previous query, but it is more concise and easier to read.

The query should return the Template_ID and Template_Type_Code for the template that appears most frequently in the Documents table.  Here is an example of a SQL query that should accomplish this: ``` SELECT t.Template_ID, t.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(*) AS num_documents FROM Templates t JOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID JOIN Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID GROUP BY t.Template_ID, t.Template_Type_Code ORDER BY num_documents DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query joins the Templates and Documents tables on the Template_ID column, and then joins the resulting table with the Paragraphs table on the Document_ID column. The query then groups the results by Template_ID and Template_Type_Code, and counts the number of documents for each template. The results are then ordered by the number of documents in descending order, and the top result (the template used by the most documents) is returned.  Note that this query assumes that the Template_ID and Template_Type_Code columns in the Templates and Documents tables are not nullable, and that the Document_ID column in the Paragraphs table is not nullable. If these assumptions are not true, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the results to only include templates that are used by more than one document.  The `COUNT(DISTINCT d.Document_ID)` function counts the number of distinct `Document_ID` 1s for each template, and the `> 1` condition ensures that only templates that are used by more than one document are included in the results.

You can then use a HAVING clause to filter the results to only include templates that have been used in more than one document.

It then groups the results by Template_ID and counts the number of Document_IDs for each Template_ID using the COUNT(DISTINCT) function. Finally, it uses a HAVING clause to filter the results to only include templates that have been used in more than one document.  Note that this query assumes that the Template_ID column in the Templates table is the primary key, and that the Document_ID column in the Documents table is the primary key.

Here's an example query: ``` SELECT tt.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(*) AS num_templates FROM Ref_Template_Types tt JOIN Templates t ON tt.Template_Type_Code = t.Template_Type_Code JOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID GROUP BY tt.Template_Type_Code ORDER BY num_templates DESC ``` This query joins the `Ref_Template_Types` table with the `Templates` table on the `Template_Type_Code` column, and then joins the `Templates` table with the `Documents` table on the `Template_ID` column. It then groups the data by the `Template_Type_Code` column and counts the number of templates for each type. The result is a list of template type codes and the number of templates for each type, ordered by the number of templates in descending order.  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_Type_Code` column in the `Ref_Template_Types` table is a primary key, and that the `Template_ID` column in the `Templates` table is a foreign key referencing the `Template_ID` column in the `Documents` table. If these assumptions are not true, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

hard pred: To find the type code of the template type that the most templates belong to, we need to first find the number of templates that belong to each type. We can do this by using a query that groups the templates by their type and counts the number of templates in each group.  Here is the query: ``` SELECT Template_Type_Code, COUNT(*) AS num_templates FROM Templates GROUP BY Template_Type_Code ORDER BY num_templates DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query will return the type code of the template type that has the most templates, along with the number of templates that belong to that type.  To explain the query, we first select the Template_Type_Code and COUNT(*) columns from the Templates table. We then group the results by the Template_Type_Code column, which allows us to count the number of templates that belong to each type.  We then use the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses to sort the results by the number of templates in each group, and limit the results to the first row (which will have the highest number of templates).  Finally, we select the Template_Type_Code column from the first row, which will give us the type code of the template type that has the most templates.

The subquery first groups the `Template_ID`s by `Template_ID` and then filters the results to only include `Template_ID`s that have a count of less than 3.  The outer query then selects the `Template_Type_Code` for each of the filtered `Template_ID`s.

The `HAVING` clause filters the results to only include template types that have fewer than 3 templates.  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_Type_Code` column in the `Ref_Template_Types` table is the primary key, and that the `Template_ID` column in the `Templates` table is the primary key.

The `MIN` function is used to find the smallest `Version_Number` for each `Template_Type_Code`.  Note that this query assumes that the `Version_Number` column is of type `INT` and that the `Template_Type_Code` column is of type `VARCHAR`.

Here is the SQL command to achieve this: ```sql SELECT tt.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(DISTINCT d.Document_ID) AS Num_Documents FROM Ref_Template_Types tt JOIN Templates t ON tt.Template_Type_Code = t.Template_Type_Code JOIN Documents d ON t.Template_ID = d.Template_ID GROUP BY tt.Template_Type_Code ``` This query will return a result set with two columns: `Template_Type_Code` and `Num_Documents`, where `Template_Type_Code` is the unique code for each template type, and `Num_Documents` is the number of documents that use each type.  For example, if we have two template types with codes `01` and `02`, and three documents that use each type, the result set would look like this: ``` Template_Type_Code Num_Documents 01                 2 02                 1 ```

It then groups the results by the `Template_Type_Code` and counts the number of distinct `Document_ID` 1s for each group. The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses are used to sort the results by the number of documents in descending order and return only the first row (which corresponds to the template type code used by the most number of documents).  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_Type_Code` column in the `Ref_Template_Types` table is a primary key, and that the `Template_ID` column in the `Templates` table is a foreign key referencing the `Template_ID` column in the `Documents` table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all rows from the `Ref_Template_Types` table are included in the result set, even if there is no matching row in the `Templates` table. The `WHERE` clause filters the result set to only include rows where the `Template_ID` column is null, indicating that the template type code is not used by any document.  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_Type_Code` column in the `Ref_Template_Types` table is the primary key, and that the `Template_ID` column in the `Templates` table is the primary key.

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return only distinct 1s for the `Template_Type_Description` column, which will give you the list of unique template type descriptions that have been used by any document.  Note that this query assumes that the `Template_Type_Code` column in the `Templates` table is a foreign key referencing the `Template_Type_Code` column in the `Ref_Template_Types` table, and that the `Template_ID` column in the `Documents` table is a foreign key referencing the `Template_ID` column in the `Templates` table.

The result is a list of documents, each with their ID, name, and the number of paragraphs in the document.  Note that this query assumes that the `Paragraphs` table contains a column called `Paragraph_ID` that is the primary key of the table, and that the `Documents` table contains a column called `Document_ID` that is the foreign key that links to the `Paragraphs` table. If your tables have different column names, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.

The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of paragraphs for each document.  You can use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by `Document_ID` and `Document_Name`, and the `COUNT` function to count the number of paragraphs for each document.  You can also use the `JOIN` clause to join the `Documents` and `Paragraphs` tables on the `Document_ID` column, and then use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by `Document_ID` and `Document_Name`.  You can also use the `SELECT` clause to select the columns you want to retrieve, such as `Document_ID`, `Document_Name`, and `Number_of_Paragraphs`.  You can also use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on certain conditions, such as `WHERE d.Document_ID = 1`.  You can also use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results based on certain columns, such as `ORDER BY d.Document_ID`.

easy pred: To find the ids of documents that have 2 or more paragraphs, you can use a SQL query that joins the Documents and Paragraphs tables and filters the results based on the number of paragraphs.  Here is an example query: ``` SELECT d.Document_ID FROM Documents d JOIN Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID GROUP BY d.Document_ID HAVING COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) >= 2; ``` This query joins the Documents and Paragraphs tables on the Document_ID column, and then groups the results by Document_ID. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include Document_IDs that have 2 or more paragraphs.  You can also use a subquery to achieve the same result: ``` SELECT d.Document_ID FROM Documents d WHERE d.Document_ID IN (   SELECT p.Document_ID   FROM Paragraphs p   GROUP BY p.Document_ID   HAVING COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) >= 2 ); ``` This subquery selects the Document_IDs that have 2 or more paragraphs, and then the outer query selects the Documents with those Document_IDs.  Both of these queries should return the ids of documents that have 2 or more paragraphs.

The `COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID)` function is used to count the number of paragraphs for each document, and the results are ordered by the number of paragraphs in descending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the first result, which is the document with the most paragraphs.  Note that this query assumes that the `Document_ID` column is the primary key of the `Documents` table, and that the `Paragraph_ID` column is the primary key of the `Paragraphs` table.

The `COUNT(Paragraph_ID)` function counts the number of paragraphs for each document, and the `ASC` order specifies that the documents with the fewest paragraphs should be returned first. Finally, the `LIMIT 1` clause limits the results to only the first document in the ordered list.  Note that this query assumes that the `Document_ID` column is the primary key of the `Documents` table, and that the `Paragraph_ID` column is the primary key of the `Paragraphs` table.

The `BETWEEN` operator is used to specify the range of paragraph IDs that are included in the result set.  Note that this query assumes that the `Paragraph_ID` column in the `Paragraphs` table is an integer column that represents the ordinal position of the paragraph within the document. If the `Paragraph_ID` column is not an integer, or if the ordinal position of the paragraph is not stored in this column, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `HAVING` clause is then used to filter the results to only include documents that have between one and two paragraphs. The final `SELECT` clause retrieves the document IDs from the resulting rows.

Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT v.ID, v.Name, v.Level_of_membership, SUM(t.Total_spent) AS Total_Spent FROM visit t JOIN visitor v ON t.visitor_ID = v.ID GROUP BY v.ID, v.Name, v.Level_of_membership ORDER BY Total_Spent DESC; ``` This query will return the visitor_ID, name, membership level, and total amount spent by each visitor who has spent the largest amount of money in all museum tickets.

It then counts the number of visits for each museum and sorts the results in descending order by the number of visits. The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the top result, which is the museum visited most times.  The output of this query will be a single row containing the `Museum_ID`, `Name`, and `num_visits` columns, with the `num_visits` column containing the number of visits for the most visited museum.

We can then use a `LEFT JOIN` to include all museums, even if they have no visitors.  Here is the SQL command: ``` SELECT m.Name FROM museum m LEFT JOIN visit v ON m.Museum_ID = v.Museum_ID LEFT JOIN visitor v2 ON v.visitor_ID = v2.ID WHERE v2.ID IS NULL; ``` This command will return the name of the museum that had no visitor yet.

It then groups the results by the `Name` and `Age` columns of the `visitor` table and orders the results by the number of tickets bought at once (count of `visitor_ID` column in the `visit` table). The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the first result, which is the visitor who bought the most tickets at once.  Note that this command assumes that the `visitor` table has a unique `ID` column, and that the `visit` table has a foreign key relationship with the `visitor` table on the `visitor_ID` column. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the command accordingly.

It then filters the results to only include visitors whose membership level is 1, and calculates the total ticket expense for those visitors.  The result of the query will be a single 1, which is the total ticket expense of the visitors whose membership level is 1.  Note: This is just an example query, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific database and schema. Additionally, you should always use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.

extra pred: To find the name of the visitor who visited both a museum opened before 2009 and a museum opened after 2011, we need to first find the museums that were opened before 2009 and after 2011. We can do this by using the following SQL query: ``` SELECT * FROM museum WHERE Open_Year < 2009 AND Open_Year > 2011; ``` This query will return the names of the museums that were opened before 2009 and after 2011.  Next, we need to find the visitors who visited both of these museums. We can do this by using a self-join, where we join the visit table with itself to find visitors who visited both museums. The query would look like this: ``` SELECT v1.Name FROM visit v1 JOIN visit v2 ON v1.visitor_ID = v2.visitor_ID WHERE v1.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year < 2009) AND v2.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year > 2011); ``` This query will return the names of the visitors who visited both museums.  So, the complete SQL query to find the name of the visitor who visited both a museum opened before 2009 and a museum opened after 2011 would be: ``` SELECT v1.Name FROM visit v1 JOIN visit v2 ON v1.visitor_ID = v2.visitor_ID WHERE v1.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year < 2009) AND v2.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year > 2011); ```

Here is an example query: ``` SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS num_matches FROM matches JOIN players ON matches.winner_id = players.player_id JOIN players ON matches.loser_id = players.player_id GROUP BY year ORDER BY num_matches DESC ``` This query will join the matches table with the players table on the winner_id and loser_id columns, and then group the results by year and count the number of matches for each year. The results will be sorted in descending order by the number of matches, so the year with the most number of matches will be listed first.  Note that this query assumes that the winner_id and loser_id columns in the matches table are foreign keys that reference the player_id column in the players table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

hard pred: To find the year with the most matches, we need to first join the tables to get the winner and loser IDs for each match. We can then group the matches by year and count the number of matches for each year.  Here is the SQL command to do this: ``` SELECT year, COUNT(*) as num_matches FROM matches JOIN players ON matches.winner_id = players.player_id JOIN players ON matches.loser_id = players.player_id GROUP BY year ORDER BY num_matches DESC ``` This will return the year with the most matches, along with the number of matches for that year.  Note that this command assumes that the `matches` table has a column called `year` that contains the year of the match. If the `year` column is named something else, you will need to modify the command accordingly.

It then filters the results to only include matches that took place at Grand Slam tournaments. Finally, it groups the results by the winner's name and rank points, and orders the results by the number of matches won in descending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top winner is returned.

It then joins the `rankings` table on the `player_id` column. The `COUNT(match_num)` and `SUM(ranking_points)` aggregate functions are used to count the number of matches and total rank points for each winner. The results are then grouped by winner name and ordered by the number of matches and total rank points in descending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the first row of the result set, which will be the winner with the most matches and the highest total rank points.

The `JOIN` condition is set to match the `loser_id` and `winner_id` columns in the `matches` table with the `player_id` column in the `players` table.  The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include matches with the greatest number of minutes. The `MAX` function is used to get the maximum 1 of the `minutes` column from the `matches` table.  The result of the query will be a table with four columns: the loser's first and last name, the winner's first and last name, and the number of minutes played in the match.

Here is an example query: ``` SELECT country_code, COUNT(*) AS num_players FROM players JOIN rankings ON players.player_id = rankings.player_id GROUP BY country_code; ``` This query will return a result set with two columns: `country_code` and `num_players`. The `country_code` column will contain the country code for each player, and the `num_players` column will contain the number of players from that country.  For example, if the `players` table contains the following data: ``` player_id | first_name | last_name | country_code 1         | John       | Doe       | US 2         | Jane       | Smith     | US 3         | Bob        | Johnson   | UK 4         | Sarah      | Brown     | UK 5         | Michael    | Davis     | FR ``` And the `rankings` table contains the following data: ``` ranking_date | ranking | player_id | ranking_points | tours 2022-01-01  | 1       | 1         | 1000            | 5 2022-01-01  | 2       | 2         | 800             | 5 2022-01-01  | 3       | 3         | 600             | 5 2022-01-01  | 4       | 4         | 400             | 5 2022-01-01  | 5       | 5         | 200             | 5 ``` Then the query will return the following result set: ``` country_code | num_players US           | 2 UK           | 2 FR           | 1 ``` This shows that there are 2 players from the United States, 2 players from the United Kingdom, and 1 player from France.

You can also use the HAVING clause to filter the results based on a condition on an aggregate function. For example, to find the number of players from each country who have a ranking of at least 1000, you can use the following query: ``` SELECT country_code, COUNT(*) AS num_players FROM players JOIN rankings ON players.player_id = rankings.player_id GROUP BY country_code HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1000 ``` This query will return a table with two columns: country_code and num_players, where num_players is the number of players from each country who have a ranking of at least 1000.

db_id: wta_1
medium pred: To answer the question, we need to first identify the relationship between the tables. The winner_id and player_id columns in the matches table are the foreign keys that link to the player_id column in the players table. Similarly, the loser_id and player_id columns in the matches table are the foreign keys that link to the player_id column in the players table.  To find the total number of tours for each ranking date, we can use a join operation to combine the data from the matches and rankings tables. We can then group the data by the ranking_date column and use the COUNT function to count the number of tours for each ranking date.  Here is the SQL command to achieve this: ``` SELECT ranking_date, COUNT(DISTINCT tourney_id) AS total_tours FROM matches JOIN rankings ON matches.winner_id = rankings.player_id GROUP BY ranking_date; ``` This command will return a table with two columns: ranking_date and total_tours. The ranking_date column will contain the date for each ranking, and the total_tours column will contain the total number of tours for each ranking date.  Note that the DISTINCT keyword is used in the COUNT function to count the number of unique tourney_id 1s for each ranking date, rather than counting the total number of tours for each ranking date. This is because the same tourney_id 1 may be associated with multiple ranking_date 1s.

The year column will contain the year in which each match was played, and the num_matches column will contain the number of matches played in that year.  You can then use this query to generate a list of years and the number of matches played in each year. For example, you could use the following code to print the results to the console: ``` for row in cursor.execute(query):     print(f"{row[0]} - {row[1]} matches") ``` This will print a list of years and the number of matches played in each year, with each line containing the year and the number of matches, separated by a dash. For example: ``` 2020 - 100 matches 2021 - 120 matches 2022 - 150 matches ``` I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

It then filters the results to only include matches where the winner's minutes played is less than 300, and orders the results by the winner's minutes played in ascending order. Finally, it limits the results to the top 3 youngest winners.  Note that this query assumes that the `minutes` column in the `matches` table represents the number of minutes played by the winner, and that the `ranking` column in the `rankings` table represents the winner's ranking at the time of the match.

The tables involved in the query are `matches`, `players`, and `rankings`. The columns we need to retrieve are the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ranking` columns from the `players` table, and the `match_num` column from the `matches` table.  To get the three youngest winners across all matches, we need to find the minimum 1 of the `match_num` column from the `matches` table, and then use that 1 to retrieve the corresponding row from the `players` table.  Here is the SQL query that should accomplish this: ``` SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, r.ranking FROM players p JOIN matches m ON p.player_id = m.winner_id JOIN rankings r ON p.player_id = r.player_id WHERE m.match_num = (SELECT MIN(match_num) FROM matches); ``` This query first joins the `matches` and `players` tables on the `winner_id` column, and then joins the `rankings` table on the `player_id` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where the `match_num` column is the minimum 1 across all matches.  Note that this query assumes that the `match_num` column is unique and non-null for each match. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query to use a different column or join condition to ensure that the correct rows are retrieved.

extra pred: To find the number of battles that did not lose any ship with tonnage '225', we need to use a combination of SQL commands.  First, we need to join the tables to get the information we need. We can use the following SQL command to join the tables: ``` SELECT *  FROM battle  JOIN ship  ON battle.id = ship.lost_in_battle  JOIN death  ON ship.id = death.caused_by_ship_id; ``` This command will give us all the information from the three tables.  Next, we need to filter the data to get only the battles that did not lose any ship with tonnage '225'. We can use the following SQL command to do this: ``` SELECT *  FROM battle  JOIN ship  ON battle.id = ship.lost_in_battle  JOIN death  ON ship.id = death.caused_by_ship_id  WHERE ship.tonnage <> '225'; ``` This command will give us all the battles that did not lose any ship with tonnage '225'.  Finally, we need to count the number of battles that did not lose any ship with tonnage '225'. We can use the following SQL command to do this: ``` SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM battle  JOIN ship  ON battle.id = ship.lost_in_battle  JOIN death  ON ship.id = death.caused_by_ship_id  WHERE ship.tonnage <> '225'; ``` This command will give us the number of battles that did not lose any ship with tonnage '225'.  Therefore, the response to the question "How many battles did not lose any ship with tonnage '225'?" is: ``` SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM battle  JOIN ship  ON battle.id = ship.lost_in_battle  JOIN death  ON ship.id = death.caused_by_ship_id  WHERE ship.tonnage <> '225'; ```

Here is the SQL query to find the department that offers the most number of degrees: ``` SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(*) AS num_degrees FROM Degree_Programs dp JOIN Departments d ON dp.department_id = d.department_id GROUP BY d.department_name ORDER BY num_degrees DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query will return the department name and the number of degrees offered by that department. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by department name, and the `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of degrees in each department. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results by the number of degrees in descending order, and the `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the first result (i.e., the department with the most number of degrees).

Based on the provided schema, the table we need to query is `Student_Enrolment`.  To find the students who are enrolled in a Bachelor degree program, we can use the following SQL query: ``` SELECT first_name, middle_name, last_name FROM Student_Enrolment JOIN Degree_Programs ON Student_Enrolment.degree_program_id = Degree_Programs.degree_program_id WHERE Degree_Programs.degree_summary_name = 'Bachelor'; ``` This query joins the `Student_Enrolment` table with the `Degree_Programs` table on the `degree_program_id` column, and then filters the results to only include students who are enrolled in a Bachelor degree program.  The output of this query will be a list of students who are enrolled in a Bachelor degree program, with their first name, middle name, and last name.

The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include students enrolled in a Bachelors program. The `SELECT` clause retrieves the first, middle, and last names for each student.  Note that this query assumes that the `degree_summary_name` column in the `degree_programs` table contains the name of the degree program, and that the `student_id` column in the `student_enrolment` table contains the ID of the student. If these columns have different names or data types, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results by the number of students in descending order, and the `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the first row (which will be the program with the most number of students).  Note that this query assumes that the `degree_program_id` column in the `student_enrolment` table is a foreign key referencing the `degree_program_id` column in the `degree_programs` table.

It then filters the results to only include courses that have at least one student enrolled in them. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each course name is only returned once, even if there are multiple students enrolled in the same course.  Note that this query assumes that the `Student_Enrolment_Courses` table has a column called `course_id` that refers to the `Courses` table, and a column called `student_id` that refers to the `Students` table.

It then filters the results to only include students whose `current_address_id` is not equal to their `address_id`, which means that their permanent address is different from their current address. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows, in case a student has multiple addresses.  The output of this query will be a list of students whose permanent address is different from their current address, along with their first name.

easy pred: To find the first name of the student whose permanent address is different from their current one, you can use the following SQL query: ``` SELECT first_name FROM students WHERE permanent_address_id != current_address_id; ``` This query will return the first name of all students whose permanent address is different from their current address.  Alternatively, you can use the following query to find the first name of a specific student: ``` SELECT first_name FROM students WHERE permanent_address_id != current_address_id AND student_id = <student_id>; ``` Replace `<student_id>` with the ID of the specific student you want to find. This query will return the first name of the student with the specified ID, if their permanent address is different from their current one.

extra pred: To find the address that holds the most number of students currently, we need to first join the tables to get the student information and then group by the address id and count the number of students. Here's the SQL query: ```sql SELECT a.address_id, a.line_1, a.line_2, a.line_3, a.city, a.zip_postcode, a.state_province_county, a.country, a.other_address_details, COUNT(s.student_id) AS num_students FROM addresses a JOIN students s ON a.address_id = s.current_address_id GROUP BY a.address_id ORDER BY num_students DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query joins the `addresses` table with the `students` table on the `current_address_id` column, then groups the results by the `address_id` column and counts the number of students for each address. The results are then ordered by the number of students in descending order and the first row (which represents the address with the most number of students) is selected.  The output of this query will be a single row containing the address id, all the lines, and the number of students currently residing at that address.  Note that this query assumes that the `current_address_id` column in the `students` table is a foreign key referencing the `address_id` column in the `addresses` table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of students enrolled at each address, and the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by address and line. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results by the number of students, and the `LIMIT` clause is used to limit the results to only the first row (i.e., the address with the most students).  Note that this query assumes that the `student_enrolment` table contains a column called `current_address_id` that references the `addresses` table, and that the `students` table contains a column called `student_id` that references the `student_enrolment` table. If these columns are named differently in your database, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.

We can do this by finding the average date of the transcript_date column in the Transcripts table.  Here is the SQL command to find the average date of when the transcripts were printed: ``` SELECT AVG(transcript_date) FROM Transcripts; ``` This command will return the average date of when the transcripts were printed.  For example, if the transcript_date column contains the following 1s:  | transcript_date | | --- | | 2020-01-01 | | 2020-01-02 | | 2020-01-03 | | 2020-01-04 | | 2020-01-05 | | 2020-01-06 | | 2020-01-07 | | 2020-01-08 | | 2020-01-09 | | 2020-01-10 |  The average date of when the transcripts were printed would be:  | AVG(transcript_date) | | --- | | 2020-01-05 |  This means that the transcripts were printed on average on January 5th.

easy pred: To find the average transcript date, you can use the following SQL query: ``` SELECT AVG(transcript_date) FROM transcripts; ``` This query will return the average transcript date for all transcripts in the `transcripts` table.  If you want to include only the transcripts for a specific student, you can add a `WHERE` clause to the query, like this: ``` SELECT AVG(transcript_date) FROM transcripts WHERE student_id = 123; ``` This will return the average transcript date for all transcripts for student with `student_id` equal to 123.  If you want to include only the transcripts for a specific degree program, you can add a `WHERE` clause to the query, like this: ``` SELECT AVG(transcript_date) FROM transcripts WHERE degree_program_id = 123; ``` This will return the average transcript date for all transcripts for degree program with `degree_program_id` equal to 123.  If you want to include only the transcripts for a specific semester, you can add a `WHERE` clause to the query, like this: ``` SELECT AVG(transcript_date) FROM transcripts WHERE semester_id = 123; ``` This will return the average transcript date for all transcripts for semester with `semester_id` equal to 123.  Note that the `AVG` function will return the average of the transcript dates, and the `WHERE` clause will filter the results to only include transcripts for the specified student, degree program, or semester.

The `MIN` function is used to find the minimum `transcript_date` in the table.  The query also uses the `JOIN` clause to join the tables based on the foreign keys defined in the database. This allows us to find the first transcript released by joining the `Transcripts` table with the other tables that contain information about the students, courses, and semesters.  The query is written in a way that it is easy to read and understand, and it is also optimized for performance.

This column represents the date when the transcript was released.  To get the details of the transcript, you can join the `Transcripts` table with the `Transcript_Contents` table on the `transcript_id` column. This will give you the information about the courses that are included in the transcript.  Here's an example SQL query that should give you the information you need: ``` SELECT t.transcript_date, tc.course_id, c.course_name, c.course_description FROM Transcripts t JOIN Transcript_Contents tc ON t.transcript_id = tc.transcript_id JOIN Courses c ON tc.course_id = c.course_id ORDER BY t.transcript_date; ``` This query will give you the date of the transcript release, the course ID, the course name, and the course description for each course that is included in the transcript.

Next, we need to find the transcripts that contain the courses with more than one student enrolled in them. We can do this by using a subquery to find the transcripts that contain the courses we found in the previous step. ``` SELECT t.transcript_id, t.transcript_date, c.course_id, c.course_name FROM Transcripts t JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses c ON c.transcript_id = t.transcript_id WHERE c.course_id IN (     SELECT course_id     FROM Student_Enrolment_Courses     GROUP BY course_id     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) > 1 ); ``` This will give us a list of transcripts that contain the courses with more than one student enrolled in them, along with the course ID and name.  Finally, we need to find the maximum number of times each course shows up in different transcripts. We can do this by using a subquery to find the maximum number of times each course shows up in different transcripts. ``` SELECT course_id, MAX(num_transcripts) AS max_transcripts FROM (     SELECT c.course_id, COUNT(DISTINCT t.transcript_id) AS num_transcripts     FROM Transcripts t     JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses c ON c.transcript_id = t.transcript_id     WHERE c.

You can then use a `MIN` function to find the minimum number of results for each transcript.  Here is an example query: ``` SELECT t.transcript_date, COUNT(*) AS num_results FROM Transcript_Contents AS tc JOIN Transcripts AS t ON tc.transcript_id = t.transcript_id GROUP BY t.transcript_date ORDER BY num_results ASC LIMIT 1; ``` This query will return the `transcript_date` and the number of results for each transcript, sorted by the number of results in ascending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause at the end of the query will only return the first result, which is the transcript with the least number of results.  Note that this query assumes that the `transcript_date` column in the `Transcripts` table is a date or datetime column, and that the `transcript_id` column in the `Transcript_Contents` table is a foreign key referencing the `Transcripts` table.

It then joins the `Degree_Programs` table to get the degree summary name for each student, and filters the results to only include semesters where both Master and Bachelor students are enrolled. Finally, it groups the results by semester name and filters to only include semesters where both types of students are enrolled.

If you want to include the `first_name` column in the sort, you can use the following query: ``` SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY last_name DESC, first_name DESC; ``` This will sort the students by their last name, and then by their first name in reverse lexicographical order.  If you want to include other columns in the sort, you can add them to the `ORDER BY` clause, separated by commas. For example, to sort students by their last name, then by their first name, then by their email address, you can use the following query: ``` SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY last_name DESC, first_name DESC, email_address DESC; ``` This will sort the students by their last name, then by their first name, and then by their email address in reverse lexicographical order.  Note that the `DESC` keyword in the `ORDER BY` clause indicates that the sort should be done in reverse order.

hard pred: To find which countries' TV channels are not playing any cartoons written by Todd Casey, we need to first identify the TV channels that are playing cartoons written by Todd Casey. We can do this by selecting the TV channels that have a Cartoon with a directed_by 1 of Todd Casey.  Here's the SQL command to find the TV channels that are not playing any cartoons written by Todd Casey: ``` SELECT DISTINCT c.Country FROM TV_Channel c LEFT JOIN Cartoon ca ON c.id = ca.Channel WHERE ca.directed_by != 'Todd Casey' ``` This command uses a LEFT JOIN to find the TV channels that have a Cartoon with a directed_by 1 of Todd Casey. The WHERE clause then filters out the TV channels that have a Cartoon with a directed_by 1 of Todd Casey, resulting in the TV channels that are not playing any cartoons written by Todd Casey.  The DISTINCT keyword is used to ensure that each country is only listed once in the output, even if there are multiple TV channels in that country that are not playing any cartoons written by Todd Casey.

hard pred: To find the countries that are not playing cartoons written by Todd Casey, we can use a SQL query that joins the TV_Channel, TV_series, and Cartoon tables on the Channel foreign key, and then filters the results to only include rows where the directed_by column in the Cartoon table is equal to "Todd Casey".  Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM TV_Channel AS tc JOIN TV_series AS ts ON tc.id = ts.Channel JOIN Cartoon AS c ON c.Channel = tc.id WHERE c.directed_by = 'Todd Casey' ``` This query first joins the TV_Channel and TV_series tables on the Channel foreign key, and then joins the Cartoon table on the Channel foreign key. It then filters the results to only include rows where the directed_by column in the Cartoon table is equal to "Todd Casey".  The DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows in the result set, and the AS keywords are used to give the tables and columns in the query more descriptive names.  The resulting rows will contain the countries that are not playing cartoons written by Todd Casey.

It then filters the results to only include TV channels that are playing cartoons directed by both Ben Jones and Michael Chang.  Note that this query assumes that the `Directed_by` column in the `Cartoon` table contains the name of the director, and that the `Channel` column in the `Cartoon` table contains the ID of the TV channel that is playing the cartoon. If these assumptions are not correct, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The subquery groups the TV channels by country and then counts the number of distinct TV channel IDs for each country. The outer query then selects the TV channel ID for each country that has more than two TV channels.  Note that this query assumes that the `Country` column in the `TV_Channel` table contains the country name as a string.

The `WHERE` clause filters out the rows where the `Directed_by` column of the `Cartoon` table is not equal to 'Ben Jones'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set.  The resulting table will have the `id` column of the `TV_Channel` table, which is the primary key of the table.

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by the TV channel's ID, and the `SELECT` clause is used to retrieve the package option for each group.  Note that this query assumes that the `id` column in the `TV_Channel` and `TV_series` tables is the primary key, and that the `id` column in the `Cartoon` table is the foreign key that references the `id` column in the `TV_series` table. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the query accordingly.

easy pred: To find the nationalities that are shared by at least two people, we need to use a SQL query that joins the poker_player and people tables on the People_ID column. We can then group the results by nationality and use a HAVING clause to filter out nationalities that are not shared by at least two people.  Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT p.Nationality FROM poker_player p JOIN people pe ON p.People_ID = pe.People_ID GROUP BY p.Nationality HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.People_ID) >= 2; ``` This query joins the poker_player and people tables on the People_ID column, groups the results by nationality, and filters out nationalities that are not shared by at least two people using the HAVING clause. The COUNT(DISTINCT p.People_ID) >= 2 clause counts the number of distinct people IDs for each nationality and filters out nationalities that do not have at least two people.

hard pred: To list the names of people that are not poker players, you can use a LEFT JOIN query to join the poker_player table with the people table on the People_ID column. Then, you can filter the results to only include rows where the Poker_Player_ID is NULL, which means that the person is not a poker player.  Here is an example SQL query that should accomplish this: ``` SELECT people.Name FROM people LEFT JOIN poker_player ON people.People_ID = poker_player.People_ID WHERE poker_player.Poker_Player_ID IS NULL; ``` This query will return a list of names of people that are not poker players.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to find the maximum and minimum 1s of the area_code column in the AREA_CODE_STATE table, along with the corresponding state: ``` SELECT MAX(area_code), MIN(area_code), state FROM AREA_CODE_STATE GROUP BY state; ``` This command will return the maximum and minimum 1s of the area_code column in the AREA_CODE_STATE table, along with the corresponding state.  Please note that the above commands are based on the assumption that the area_code column is of type integer, and that the state column is of type string.

The `COUNT(v.vote_id)` function counts the number of votes for each contestant, and the `ASC` sort order sorts the results in ascending order based on the number of votes. Finally, the `LIMIT 1` clause limits the results to only the first row, which is the contestant with the least number of votes.  Note that this query assumes that the `vote_id` column is a unique identifier for each vote, and that the `contestant_number` column is a unique identifier for each contestant. If either of these assumptions is not true, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

extra pred: To find the number of contestants who did not get voted, you can use a SQL query that joins the VOTES table with the CONTESTANTS table on the contestant_number column, and then filters the results to only include contestants who do not have any votes.  Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CONTESTANTS LEFT JOIN VOTES ON CONTESTANTS.contestant_number = VOTES.contestant_number WHERE VOTES.contestant_number IS NULL; ``` This query uses a left join to combine the CONTESTANTS and VOTES tables, and then filters the results to only include rows where the contestant_number in the VOTES table is null, indicating that the contestant did not receive any votes. The COUNT(*) function is then used to count the number of rows in the resulting table, which gives you the number of contestants who did not get voted.  Note that this query assumes that the contestant_number column in the VOTES table is nullable, which is not necessarily the case in all databases. If the contestant_number column is not nullable, you may need to modify the query to use a subquery or a join instead of a left join.

The COUNT(*) function counts the number of votes for each area code, and the GROUP BY clause groups the results by area code. The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by the number of votes in descending order, and the LIMIT clause limits the results to the top 1 row.  This command will return the area code in which the most voters voted, along with the number of votes for that area code.

Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT DISTINCT c.Name FROM country c JOIN city ci ON c.Code = ci.CountryCode WHERE c.IndepYear > 1950 ORDER BY c.Name; ``` This query first joins the `country` table with the `city` table on the `Code` column, which is the foreign key that connects the two tables. It then filters the results to only include countries with an `IndepYear` 1 greater than 1950, and finally orders the results by the country name.  The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate country names from the results.  Note that this query assumes that the `country` table contains a column called `IndepYear` that indicates the year the country was founded. If your database does not have this column, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `country` table contains information about countries, including their GNP and population. The `city` table contains information about cities, including their country code.  To find the number of people who live in Asia and the largest GNP among them, we can use a query that joins the `country` and `city` tables based on the country code. The query would look something like this: ``` SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city.Name) AS num_people, MAX(country.GNP) AS largest_gnp FROM country JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode WHERE country.Continent = 'Asia'; ``` This query joins the `country` and `city` tables based on the `Code` column in both tables. It then filters the results to only include countries in Asia, and calculates the number of people who live in Asia and the largest GNP among them.  The `DISTINCT` keyword is used in the `COUNT` function to count the number of distinct cities, rather than the total number of cities. This is because a city can be listed in multiple countries, and we only want to count each city once.  The `MAX` function is used to calculate the largest GNP among the countries in Asia. This is because the GNP is a numerical 1, and we want to find the largest 1 in the group.  The query results will be returned in a table with two columns: `num_people` and `largest_gnp`. The `num_people` column will contain the number of people who live in Asia, and the `largest_gnp` column will contain the largest GNP among the countries in Asia.

It then filters the results to only include countries with a government form of 'Republic', and groups the results by language. Finally, it uses the `HAVING` clause to filter the results to only include languages that are used by a single country with a republic government.  Note that this query assumes that the `GovernmentForm` column in the `country` table contains the government form of each country, and that the `CountryCode` column in the `countrylanguage` table contains the code of the country that speaks each language.

Next, we need to find the official languages spoken in these countries. We can do this by joining the `country` table with the `countrylanguage` table on the `CountryCode` column. ``` SELECT countrylanguage.Language, COUNT(countrylanguage.Language) AS Count FROM country JOIN countrylanguage ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode WHERE country.IndepYear < 1930 GROUP BY countrylanguage.Language; ``` This will give us a list of all the official languages spoken in the countries that are founded before 1930, along with the number of countries where each language is spoken.

medium pred: To find the total number of distinct official languages for countries founded before 1930, we can use a SQL query that joins the country, city, and countrylanguage tables. The query should filter the results to only include countries that were founded before 1930, and then group the results by the official language and count the number of countries that speak each language.  Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT countrylanguage.Language, COUNT(*) FROM countrylanguage JOIN country ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCode JOIN city ON city.CountryCode = country.Code WHERE country.IndepYear < 1930 GROUP BY countrylanguage.Language ``` This query joins the countrylanguage table with the country table on the foreign key `CountryCode`, and then joins the city table with the country table on the foreign key `CountryCode`. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include countries that were founded before 1930. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the official language, and the `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of countries that speak each language.  The result of this query will be a table with two columns: `Language` and `Count`. The `Language` column will contain the name of each official language, and the `Count` column will contain the number of countries that speak that language.  For example, if the result of this query is: ``` Language        Count -------------------- English         5 Spanish         4 French          3 German          2 ``` This means that there are 5 countries that speak English as an official language, 4 countries that speak Spanish, 3 countries that speak French, and 2 countries that speak German.

The `ON` clause filters the rows where the population of the city is greater than the average population. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows by district and calculates the number of cities in each district. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each district is counted only once, even if there are multiple cities in that district with the same population.  The output of this query will be a table with two columns: `District` and `NumCities`. The `District` column will contain the name of each district, and the `NumCities` column will contain the number of cities in that district that have a population greater than the average population of cities.

It then joins this subquery with the `city` table on the condition that the `Population` of each city is greater than the average population calculated by the subquery. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows in the result set. Finally, the query uses the `GROUP BY` clause to group the rows by `District` and calculate the number of cities in each district with a population above the average population.  The result of this query will be a table with two columns: `District` and `num_cities`. The `District` column will contain the name of each district, and the `num_cities` column will contain the number of cities in that district with a population above the average population.

The `JOIN` clause combines the data from the `country` and `countrylanguage` tables based on the `CountryCode` column. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to include only English-speaking countries with an official language and a percentage greater than 0. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data by government form, and the `HAVING` clause filters the groups to include only those with an average life expectancy greater than 72.

Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT c.Name, SUM(p.Population) AS TotalPopulation FROM country c JOIN city p ON c.Code = p.CountryCode GROUP BY c.Name ORDER BY TotalPopulation DESC LIMIT 3; ``` This query joins the country table with the city table on the `Code` column, which is the foreign key that connects the city table to the country table. It then calculates the total population of each country by summing the population of all cities in that country. Finally, it sorts the results by the total population of each country in descending order (largest to smallest) and limits the results to the top 3 countries.  The output of this query would be a list of the names of the top 3 countries with the largest population, along with their total population.

easy pred: To list the names of conductors in descending order of years of work, you can use the following SQL command: ``` SELECT Name, COUNT(Year_of_Work) AS Years_of_Work FROM Conductor GROUP BY Name ORDER BY Years_of_Work DESC; ``` This command will select the `Name` and `COUNT(Year_of_Work)` columns from the `Conductor` table, and group the results by `Name`. The `COUNT(Year_of_Work)` column will count the number of rows for each `Name`, and the `ORDER BY` clause will sort the results in descending order of `Years_of_Work`.  Note that this command assumes that the `Year_of_Work` column is a numerical column that represents the number of years of work for each conductor. If the `Year_of_Work` column is a string column, you may need to use a different aggregate function, such as `SUM` or `AVG`, to calculate the number of years of work for each conductor.

easy pred: To get the names of conductors sorted descending by the number of years they have worked, you can use the following SQL query: ``` SELECT Name, COUNT(Year_of_Work) AS num_years FROM conductor GROUP BY Name ORDER BY num_years DESC; ``` This query will select the `Name` column from the `conductor` table, and the number of years they have worked (`COUNT(Year_of_Work)`) for each conductor. The `GROUP BY` clause will group the conductors by their names, and the `ORDER BY` clause will sort the results by the number of years they have worked in descending order.  Note that this query assumes that the `Year_of_Work` column is a numeric column that represents the number of years a conductor has worked. If the column is a date or datetime column, you may need to use a different function to calculate the number of years.

medium pred: To find the name of the conductor who has worked the greatest number of years, you can use a query that joins the conductor and performance tables on the Conductor_ID column, and then groups the results by Conductor_ID and counts the number of years worked by each conductor. You can then select the conductor with the highest count.  Here is the query: ``` SELECT c.Name, COUNT(DISTINCT p.Year) AS Years_Worked FROM conductor c JOIN performance p ON c.Conductor_ID = p.Conductor_ID GROUP BY c.Conductor_ID ORDER BY Years_Worked DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query will return the name of the conductor who has worked the greatest number of years, along with the number of years worked by that conductor.  Note that this query assumes that the Conductor_ID column in the conductor table is the primary key, and that the Conductor_ID column in the performance table is a foreign key referencing the primary key in the conductor table.

medium pred: To get the names of conductors and the corresponding orchestras that they have conducted, you can use a join query to combine the conductor and orchestra tables. Here is an example query: ``` SELECT c.Name, o.Orchestra FROM conductor c JOIN orchestra o ON c.Conductor_ID = o.Conductor_ID; ``` This query will return a table with two columns: `Name` and `Orchestra`. The `Name` column will contain the names of the conductors, and the `Orchestra` column will contain the names of the orchestras that they have conducted.  If you want to include the other columns from the conductor and orchestra tables, you can use the `SELECT` clause to specify the columns that you want to include. For example: ``` SELECT c.Name, o.Orchestra, c.Age, o.Record_Company FROM conductor c JOIN orchestra o ON c.Conductor_ID = o.Conductor_ID; ``` This query will return a table with four columns: `Name`, `Orchestra`, `Age`, and `Record_Company`. The `Name` and `Orchestra` columns will contain the same information as before, but the `Age` column will contain the age of the conductor, and the `Record_Company` column will contain the name of the record company that the orchestra is affiliated with.

extra pred: To find the name of the conductor who has conducted the most orchestras, you can use a SQL query that joins the conductor and orchestra tables on the Conductor_ID column, and then groups the results by the conductor's name and counts the number of orchestras they have conducted.  Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT c.Name, COUNT(*) AS num_orchestras FROM conductor c JOIN orchestra o ON c.Conductor_ID = o.Conductor_ID GROUP BY c.Name ORDER BY num_orchestras DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query joins the conductor and orchestra tables on the Conductor_ID column, and then groups the results by the conductor's name. The COUNT(*) function is used to count the number of orchestras each conductor has conducted. The results are then ordered by the number of orchestras conducted in descending order, and the top conductor is selected using the LIMIT clause.  The output of this query will be a single row containing the name of the conductor who has conducted the most orchestras, and the number of orchestras they have conducted. For example: ``` +-----------------+-----------------+ | Name            | num_orchestras  | +-----------------+-----------------+ | John Smith      | 10              | +-----------------+-----------------+ ``` This indicates that John Smith has conducted 10 orchestras.

We need to find the names of conductors who have conducted orchestras founded after the year 2008.  First, we need to identify the tables involved in the question. The tables are conductor, orchestra, performance, and show.  Next, we need to determine the columns that are relevant to the question. The columns that are relevant to the question are Conductor_ID, Name, Age, Nationality, Year_of_Work, Orchestra_ID, Orchestra, Record_Company, Year_of_Founded, Major_Record_Format, Performance_ID, Type, Date, Official_ratings_(millions), Weekly_rank, Share, If_first_show, Result, and Attendance.  We can use the following SQL command to find the names of conductors who have conducted orchestras founded after the year 2008: ``` SELECT Name  FROM conductor  JOIN orchestra ON conductor.Conductor_ID = orchestra.Conductor_ID  JOIN performance ON orchestra.Orchestra_ID = performance.Orchestra_ID  WHERE Year_of_Work > 2008; ``` This SQL command joins the conductor, orchestra, and performance tables based on the Conductor_ID and Orchestra_ID columns, respectively. It then filters the results to only include conductors who have conducted orchestras founded after the year 2008. The final result is a list of conductor names.

medium pred: To answer this question, we need to first identify the relationship between the record company and the orchestra. From the given information, we know that the record company is mentioned in the orchestra table, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the conductor table.  To find the number of orchestras managed by each record company, we can use a self-join to connect the orchestra and conductor tables based on the Conductor_ID column. We can then group the result by the record company and count the number of orchestras for each record company.  Here is the SQL command to achieve this: ```sql SELECT r.Record_Company, COUNT(DISTINCT o.Orchestra_ID) AS Num_Orchestras FROM orchestra o JOIN conductor c ON o.Conductor_ID = c.Conductor_ID JOIN record_company r ON c.Record_Company = r.Record_Company GROUP BY r.Record_Company; ``` This command will return a result set with two columns: the record company and the number of orchestras managed by that company.

The results are then sorted in descending order of frequency, so that the most common record format appears first.  Note that this command assumes that the `MAJOR_RECORD_FORMAT` column in the `ORCHESTRA` table contains the major record format for each orchestra, and that the `ORCHESTRA_ID` column in the `PERFORMANCE` table contains the foreign key referencing the `ORCHESTRA` table. Similarly, the `PERFORMANCE_ID` column in the `SHOW` table contains the foreign key referencing the `PERFORMANCE` table.

hard pred: To find the record company shared by the most number of orchestras, we need to find the record company that has the most number of performances.  We can start by finding the list of all the record companies that have performed with at least one orchestra. We can do this by joining the tables orchestra and performance on the Orchestra_ID column. ``` SELECT DISTINCT Record_Company FROM orchestra JOIN performance ON orchestra.Orchestra_ID = performance.Orchestra_ID; ``` This will give us a list of all the record companies that have performed with at least one orchestra.  Next, we need to find the number of performances for each record company. We can do this by grouping the results by Record_Company and using the COUNT function. ``` SELECT Record_Company, COUNT(*) AS num_performances FROM (   SELECT DISTINCT Record_Company   FROM orchestra   JOIN performance ON orchestra.Orchestra_ID = performance.Orchestra_ID ) AS t GROUP BY Record_Company; ``` This will give us a list of all the record companies and the number of performances for each record company.  Finally, we need to find the record company that has the most number of performances. We can do this by sorting the results by the num_performances column in descending order and selecting the first row. ``` SELECT Record_Company FROM (   SELECT Record_Company, COUNT(*) AS num_performances   FROM (     SELECT DISTINCT Record_Company     FROM orchestra     JOIN performance ON orchestra.Orchestra_ID = performance.Orchestra_ID   ) AS t   GROUP BY Record_Company ) AS t ORDER BY num_performances DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This will give us the record company that has the most number of performances.

We can use a SQL query like this: ``` SELECT Record_Company, COUNT(Orchestra_ID) AS num_orchestras FROM performance GROUP BY Record_Company ORDER BY num_orchestras DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query will group the performance table by Record_Company, count the number of Orchestra_IDs for each Record_Company, and then order the results by the count in descending order. The LIMIT clause is used to only return the first row, which is the record company with the highest count of Orchestra_IDs.  The output of this query will be a table with two columns: Record_Company and num_orchestras. The Record_Company column will contain the name of the record company, and the num_orchestras column will contain the number of orchestras that used that record company. The row with the highest count in the num_orchestras column will be the record company used by the greatest number of orchestras.

The WHERE clause filters the results to only include orchestras that have no performance, by checking if the performance_ID column in the performance table is NULL.  The query will return a list of orchestras that have no performance, along with the conductor's name for each orchestra. The Orchestra_ID and Orchestra columns from the orchestra table are also included in the results.  Note that this query assumes that the Orchestra_ID column in the orchestra table is the primary key, and that the Conductor_ID column in the conductor table is the foreign key that links to the orchestra table. Similarly, the Performance_ID column in the performance table is the foreign key that links to the orchestra table.

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate any duplicate record companies from the result set.  Note that this query assumes that the `Record_Company` column is in the `orchestra` table. If this column is not in the table, you will need to modify the query accordingly.

hard pred: To answer this question, we need to first identify the record companies that are used by both orchestras founded before 2003 and those founded after 2003. We can do this by using a subquery to filter the record companies that are used by both orchestras.  Here is the SQL command to retrieve the record companies that are used by both orchestras founded before 2003 and those founded after 2003: ``` SELECT DISTINCT Record_Company FROM orchestra WHERE Year_of_Founded < 2003 AND Record_Company IN (   SELECT Record_Company   FROM orchestra   WHERE Year_of_Founded >= 2003 ); ``` This command uses a subquery to filter the record companies that are used by both orchestras. The subquery retrieves the record companies that are used by orchestras founded after 2003, and the outer query filters the record companies that are used by both orchestras founded before 2003 and those founded after 2003.  The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each record company is only returned once, even if it is used by multiple orchestras. The `IN` operator is used to check if the record company is used by both orchestras.  Note that this command assumes that the `Record_Company` column is a string column and that the `Year_of_Founded` column is a numeric column. If these assumptions are not correct, the command may need to be modified accordingly.

The `COUNT(*)` function will return the number of rows that match the condition.  Alternatively, you can use the following command to get the same result: ``` SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Orchestra_ID)  FROM orchestra  WHERE Record_Company IN ('CD', 'DVD'); ``` This command will count the number of distinct `Orchestra_ID` 1s in the `orchestra` table where the `Record_Company` column is either "CD" or "DVD".

We can do this by using a SQL query that joins the `orchestra` and `performance` tables on the `Orchestra_ID` column and then groups the results by `Year_of_Founded` and uses the `COUNT` function to count the number of performances for each year.  Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT DISTINCT Year_of_Founded FROM orchestra o JOIN performance p ON o.Orchestra_ID = p.Orchestra_ID GROUP BY Year_of_Founded HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` This query will return the years in which there are multiple performances for the same orchestra.

The `HAVING` clause filters the results to only include orchestras that have had more than a single performance. The `COUNT(p.Performance_ID)` function counts the number of performances for each orchestra, and the `> 1` condition filters the results to only include orchestras that have had more than a single performance. The results are then ordered by the `Year_of_Founded` column.

Here's the query: ``` SELECT grade, COUNT(*) AS num_students FROM Highschooler JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id JOIN Likes ON Highschooler.ID = Likes.student_id GROUP BY grade ORDER BY num_students DESC ``` This query joins the three tables on the `ID` column of the `Highschooler` table, and then groups the results by `grade`. The `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of rows for each group, and the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the number of students.  To execute this query, you can use a SQL client such as MySQL Workbench or SQL Server Management Studio.  The output of this query will be a table with two columns: `grade` and `num_students`. The `grade` column will contain the grade of the high schoolers, and the `num_students` column will contain the number of high schoolers in that grade.

medium pred: To find the number of friends each student has, you can use a JOIN operation to combine the information from the Friend and Likes tables.  Here is the SQL command: ``` SELECT h.ID, COUNT(f.friend_id) AS num_friends FROM Highschooler h JOIN Friend f ON h.ID = f.student_id GROUP BY h.ID; ``` This command will return the ID of each student and the number of friends they have, based on the information in the Friend and Likes tables.  The JOIN operation combines the rows from the Friend and Likes tables based on the common ID column in both tables. The GROUP BY clause groups the rows by the ID column, and the COUNT(f.friend_id) function counts the number of rows for each ID.  The result of this query will be a table with two columns: ID and num_friends. The ID column will contain the ID of each student, and the num_friends column will contain the number of friends each student has.

medium pred: To find the names of the high schoolers and how many friends each has, you can use the following SQL query: ``` SELECT h.name, COUNT(f.friend_id) AS num_friends FROM Highschooler h LEFT JOIN Friend f ON h.ID = f.student_id GROUP BY h.name ``` This query joins the `Highschooler` table with the `Friend` table on the `ID` column, and then uses the `COUNT` function to count the number of friends for each high schooler. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by the `name` column.  The resulting table will have the following columns:  * `name`: The name of the high schooler. * `num_friends`: The number of friends that high schooler has.  For example, if the `Highschooler` table contains the following data: ``` ID  |  name  |  grade ----------------------- 1   |  John  |  12 2   |  Jane  |  12 3   |  Bob   |  12 4   |  Alice |  12 ``` And the `Friend` table contains the following data: ``` student_id  |  friend_id ----------------------- 1           |  2 1           |  3 2           |  1 2           |  4 3           |  1 3           |  4 4           |  2 4           |  3 ``` Then the resulting table from the query above will be: ``` name  |  num_friends ----------------------- John  |  2 Jane  |  2 Bob   |  2 Alice |  2 ``` This shows that John has 2 friends (Jane and Bob), Jane has 2 friends (John and Alice), Bob has 2 friends (John and Alice), and Alice has 2 friends (John and Bob).

extra pred: To find the name of the high schooler who has the greatest number of friends, we need to use a combination of SQL commands.  First, we need to find the number of friends for each high schooler. We can do this by using a subquery to count the number of rows in the Friend table where the student_id is equal to the ID of the high schooler. ``` SELECT ID, COUNT(friend_id) AS num_friends FROM Highschooler JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id GROUP BY ID ``` This will give us a table with the ID of each high schooler and the number of friends they have.  Next, we need to find the high schooler with the greatest number of friends. We can do this by using a subquery to find the maximum number of friends for any high schooler. ``` SELECT ID, num_friends FROM (   SELECT ID, COUNT(friend_id) AS num_friends   FROM Highschooler   JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id   GROUP BY ID ) AS t WHERE num_friends = (   SELECT MAX(num_friends)   FROM (     SELECT ID, COUNT(friend_id) AS num_friends     FROM Highschooler     JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id     GROUP BY ID   ) AS t ) ``` This will give us the ID and number of friends for the high schooler with the greatest number of friends.  Finally, we can use a subquery to find the name of the high schooler with the greatest number of friends. ``` SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE ID = (   SELECT ID   FROM (     SELECT ID, COUNT(friend_id) AS num_friends     FROM Highschooler     JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id     GROUP BY ID   ) AS t   WHERE num_friends = (     SELECT MAX(num_friends)     FROM (       SELECT ID, COUNT(friend_id) AS num_friends       FROM Highschooler       JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id       GROUP BY ID     )

It then joins the Friend and Likes tables on the student_id column, to get a list of all high schoolers and their friends who have liked someone else. Finally, it uses a HAVING clause to filter the results based on the number of friends, and returns only the names of high schoolers who have 3 or more friends.  Note that this query assumes that the foreign key relationships between the tables are set up correctly, and that the ID column in the Highschooler table is the primary key. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The COUNT(DISTINCT) function is used to count the number of unique 1s in the friend_id column, which will give you the number of friends that Kyle has.  Note that this query assumes that the Highschooler table has a column called ID that contains the ID of the high school student, and that the Friend and Likes tables have columns called student_id and liked_id that match the ID column of the Highschooler table. If your table names or column names are different, you'll need to adjust the query accordingly.

medium pred: To answer the question, we need to first understand the relationship between the tables. From the information provided, we know that the tables `Friend` and `Likes` have foreign keys that reference the primary key `ID` of table `Highschooler`. This means that each row in `Friend` and `Likes` is associated with a specific student in `Highschooler`.  To find the number of likes corresponding to each student ID, we can use a SQL query that joins the tables `Friend` and `Likes` on the foreign keys, and then groups the results by the `student_id` in `Friend`. The query would look something like this: ``` SELECT f.student_id, COUNT(l.liked_id) AS num_likes FROM Friend f JOIN Likes l ON f.student_id = l.student_id GROUP BY f.student_id; ``` This query will return a result set with two columns: `student_id` and `num_likes`. The `student_id` column will contain the ID of each student in `Highschooler`, and the `num_likes` column will contain the number of likes corresponding to each student.  Note that this query assumes that the foreign keys in the tables `Friend` and `Likes` are correctly defined, and that there are no duplicate rows in the tables. If there are any errors in the data or the relationships between the tables, the query may not produce the expected results.

Here is the SQL query: ``` SELECT DISTINCT o.state FROM Owners o JOIN Professionals p ON o.state = p.state GROUP BY o.state HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT o.state) > 1 ``` This query first joins the Owners and Professionals tables on the state column. It then groups the results by state and uses a HAVING clause to filter for states that have both owners and professionals. The COUNT(DISTINCT o.state) > 1 clause counts the number of unique states in the group and checks if it is greater than 1, which means there are both owners and professionals living in that state.  The DISTINCT keyword is used in the SELECT clause to return only unique 1s for the state column. This is necessary because the join operation can produce duplicate rows if there are multiple owners or professionals in the same state. The GROUP BY clause is used to group the results by state, and the HAVING clause is used to filter the results based on the count of unique states.

Here is an example SQL query that does this: ``` SELECT breed_name FROM Dogs JOIN Breeds ON Dogs.breed_code = Breeds.breed_code GROUP BY breed_name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query joins the Dogs and Breeds tables on the breed_code column, and then uses a GROUP BY clause to group the dogs by breed. The COUNT(*) clause counts the number of dogs in each breed, and the ORDER BY clause sorts the results by the count in descending order. The LIMIT clause limits the results to only the first row, which is the breed with the highest count.  Note that this query assumes that the breed_code column in the Dogs table is a foreign key that references the breed_code column in the Breeds table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query to join the tables on a different column.

medium pred: To get the cost and treatment type description of each treatment, you can use a join to combine the Treatments and Treatment_Types tables.  Here is an example SQL query that should return the cost and treatment type description of each treatment: ``` SELECT t.treatment_id, t.cost_of_treatment, tt.treatment_type_description FROM Treatments t JOIN Treatment_Types tt ON t.treatment_type_code = tt.treatment_type_code; ``` This query joins the Treatments and Treatment_Types tables on the treatment_type_code column, which is the foreign key in the Treatments table that references the primary key in the Treatment_Types table. The result set will include the treatment_id, cost_of_treatment, and treatment_type_description columns from both tables.  You can modify this query to include additional columns from the tables, such as the date_of_treatment or professional_id, by adding those columns to the SELECT clause and joining the tables on the appropriate columns. For example: ``` SELECT t.treatment_id, t.cost_of_treatment, tt.treatment_type_description, t.date_of_treatment, p.first_name, p.last_name FROM Treatments t JOIN Treatment_Types tt ON t.treatment_type_code = tt.treatment_type_code JOIN Professionals p ON t.professional_id = p.professional_id; ``` This query will include the date_of_treatment, first_name, and last_name columns from the Professionals table in the result set.
